1. Complete your red-black tree implementation so that insert performs the appropriate rebalancing operations.

2. How long does your upgraded implementation take to insert 100,000 random values? What about 100,000 values in sorted order?

3. Augment your red-black tree to track the height of the tree. What’s the height after inserting 100,000 values in sorted order?

4. Write a function that converts a sorted array into a red-black tree. Note that it’s possible to perform this conversion in linear time!
